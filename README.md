# Advanced Locomotion V3, C++ template module

Developed with Unreal Engine 4.22.3.  
This is a C++ port of our favorite advanced locomotion system from our friends at 
[Longmire Locomotion](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/LongmireLocomotion).  An advanced bipedal
 character locomotion system focusing on high quality character animation with responsive movement.

Too often game animation lacks quality due to the underlying movement and animation systems being poorly designed. 
Animators can create good looking assets, but a badly designed animation system can diminish their quality in-game. 
This system's purpose is to bridge the gap between the front end and back end of in-game animation, 
and give animators a good foundation to create assets that will work well with responsive character movement.

Place this project into [UNREAL_INSTALL_DIR]/Templates/ and away you go, use it as any other template.

## Features:
* Rigged to unreal mannequin skeleton.
* Keeps player in constant control.
* Simplifies animator workload wherever possible.
* Is very flexible and highly adjustable.
* Built in mini map system with points of interest.
* Built in health component for tracking player health and damage.
* Fully networked.
